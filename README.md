for the student players will be visible. The form is sent by clicking

The team view shows all teams that were created. Below each team
is a drop down field. It shows all players that haven't been bound
to a team yet. By selecting the player and clicking add player the
player will be added to the team above. 

The blue plus button is for adding a new team. Each team can be edited
and deleted by clicking the buttons next to the name.
